## Laduma-Analytics-Football-League-Winners-Prediction-Challenge
This is my repo for [the Laduma Analytics Football League Winners Prediction Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/laduma-analytics-football-league-winners-prediction-challenge). The objective of this competition is to predict the odds of win-draw-lose of one season football matches based on two previous seasons outcomes.
After much understanding and analysis of the data provided I managed to get rank **15** out of **150**. \
The dataset is available [here](https://zindi.africa/competitions/laduma-analytics-football-league-winners-prediction-challenge/data)
